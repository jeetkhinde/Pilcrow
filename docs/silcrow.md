# Silcrow.js

A lightweight client-side runtime for building hypermedia-driven applications. Silcrow handles DOM patching, client-side navigation, response caching, live SSE and WebSocket connections, optimistic updates, and server-driven UI orchestration — all from declarative HTML attributes.

Silcrow.js is the frontend counterpart to [Pilcrow](readme.md) but operates independently as a standalone library. Any backend that speaks HTTP and returns HTML or JSON can drive it.

## Loading

Silcrow.js is a single self-executing IIFE with no dependencies. Include it in your page:

```html
<script src="/_silcrow/silcrow.js" defer></script>
```

If using Pilcrow on the backend, use the `script_tag()` helper which returns a fingerprinted URL with immutable caching.

Enable debug mode by adding `s-debug` to the body:

```html
<body s-debug>
```

This enables console warnings and throws on template validation errors.

## Three Systems

Silcrow.js has three independent systems exposed through a single `window.Silcrow` API:

1. **Runtime** — reactive data binding and DOM patching via `s-bind` and `s-list` attributes
2. **Navigator** — client-side routing, history management, and response caching via `s-action` attributes
3. **Live** — SSE and WebSocket connections, optimistic updates, and real-time data streaming via `s-live` attributes

---

## Runtime: Data Binding & DOM Patching

### Scalar Binding with `s-bind`

Bind any element to a data path. The format is `s-bind="path"` for text content or `s-bind="path:property"` for element properties.

```html
<h1 s-bind="user.name"></h1>
<input s-bind="user.email:value" />
<img s-bind="user.avatar:src" />
<button s-bind="user.banned:disabled"></button>
```

Patch data into the DOM:

```js
Silcrow.patch({
  user: { name: "Alice", email: "a@b.com", avatar: "/img/alice.png", banned: false }
}, "#app");
```

The second argument is a root — either a CSS selector string or a DOM `Element`. Silcrow only patches bindings within that root.

**Known properties** (`value`, `checked`, `disabled`, `selected`, `src`, `href`, `selectedIndex`) are set as DOM properties. Everything else is set as an attribute. `null` or `undefined` values reset properties to their type default or remove attributes.

**Security:** Binding to event handler attributes (`onclick`, `onload`, etc.) is rejected. Text content is set via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`.

### Collection Rendering with `s-list`

Render arrays of keyed objects into a container. Each item **must** have a `key` property.

```html
<ul s-list="todos" s-template="todo-tpl">
</ul>

<template id="todo-tpl">
  <li>
    <span s-bind=".text"></span>
    <input type="checkbox" s-bind=".done:checked" />
  </li>
</template>
```

```js
Silcrow.patch({
  todos: [
    { key: "1", text: "Buy milk", done: false },
    { key: "2", text: "Write docs", done: true },
  ]
}, "#app");
```

**Local bindings** use a leading dot (`.text`, `.done`) — they bind to fields on the individual item, not the global data object.

**Reconciliation:** Silcrow uses keyed reconciliation. Existing DOM nodes are reused by key, new items are created from the template, removed items are deleted, and order is maintained by repositioning. Duplicate keys are rejected.

**Template resolution order:**

1. Item key prefix — if `key` is `"special#3"`, Silcrow looks for `<template id="special">`
2. `s-template` attribute on the container
3. Inline `<template>` child of the container

**Template rules:** Templates must contain exactly one element child. Scripts and event handler attributes inside templates are rejected during validation.

### `Silcrow.patch(data, root, options?)`

The core patching function. Options:

- `invalidate: true` — rebuilds the binding map from scratch (use after DOM mutations)
- `silent: true` — suppresses the `silcrow:patched` custom event

After each patch, a `silcrow:patched` event fires on the root with `detail.paths` listing all bound paths.

### `Silcrow.invalidate(root)`

Clears the cached binding map and template validations for a root. Call this when you've added or removed `s-bind` / `s-list` elements dynamically.

### `Silcrow.stream(root)`

Returns a microtask-batched update function. Multiple calls within the same microtask are coalesced — only the last data wins.

```js
const update = Silcrow.stream("#dashboard");
update({ count: 1 });
update({ count: 2 });
update({ count: 3 }); // only this patch executes
```

### Path Resolution

Dot-separated paths resolve into nested objects: `"user.profile.name"` reads `data.user.profile.name`. Prototype pollution paths (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) are blocked and return `undefined`.

---

## Navigator: Client-Side Routing

### Declarative Navigation with `s-action`

Add `s-action` to any element to make it navigate on click:

```html
<a s-action="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
<button s-action="/api/save" POST>Save</button>
<button s-action="/items/5" DELETE s-target="#item-5">Remove</button>
```

### Attributes

| Attribute | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `s-action` | URL to request | *(required)* |
| `s-target` | CSS selector — swap response into this element | The triggering element itself |
| `s-html` | Request `text/html` instead of `application/json` | JSON |
| `s-skip-history` | Don't push to browser history | Push for full-page GETs |
| `s-preload` | Preload on mouse hover | Off |
| `s-timeout` | Request timeout in ms | `30000` |
| `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` | HTTP method (as attribute) | `GET` (or `POST` for forms) |

### Forms

Forms with `s-action` are intercepted automatically. `GET` forms append `FormData` as query params. Other methods send `FormData` as the body.

```html
<form s-action="/search" GET s-target="#results">
  <input name="q" />
  <button>Search</button>
</form>
```

### Programmatic Navigation

```js
Silcrow.go("/dashboard");
Silcrow.go("/api/items", { method: "POST", body: { name: "New" }, target: "#list" });
```

### Response Processing

The navigator reads the `Content-Type` header to decide how to handle the response:

- **JSON** (`application/json`) — parsed and passed to `Silcrow.patch()` on the target element
- **HTML** (`text/html`) — sanitized and swapped into the target element's `innerHTML`

For HTML responses, if the response is a full page (`<!DOCTYPE` or `<html`), Silcrow extracts the `<title>` and the matching `s-target` selector content (or `<body>` as fallback).

**HTML sanitization:** Silcrow uses the Sanitizer API (`el.setHTML()`) when available. When it isn't, a DOMParser fallback strips all `<script>` elements and event handler attributes (`on*`) before insertion.

### Server-Driven Headers

The backend can control Silcrow's behavior through response headers. These are split into two phases: headers processed during the fetch, and side-effect headers executed after the main swap.

**During fetch:**

| Header | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `silcrow-trigger` | Fire custom DOM events. JSON object `{"event-name": detail}` or a plain event name string. |
| `silcrow-retarget` | CSS selector — override where the response is swapped into. |
| `silcrow-push` | Override the URL pushed to browser history. |
| `silcrow-cache` | Set to `no-cache` to prevent this response from being cached. |

**After swap (side effects):**

| Header | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `silcrow-patch` | JSON `{"target": "#el", "data": {...}}` — patches data into a secondary element via `Silcrow.patch()`. |
| `silcrow-invalidate` | CSS selector — rebuilds binding maps for the target element via `Silcrow.invalidate()`. |
| `silcrow-navigate` | URL path — triggers a client-side navigation after the swap completes. |
| `silcrow-sse` | URL path — dispatches a `silcrow:sse` event signaling the client to open an SSE connection. |
| `silcrow-ws` | URL path — dispatches a silcrow:ws event signaling the client to open a WebSocket connection. |

Side-effect headers execute in order: patch → invalidate → navigate → sse/ws. This lets a single response update the primary target, patch a secondary counter, rebuild a sidebar, and trigger a follow-up navigation.

### Caching

GET responses are cached in-memory for 5 minutes (max 50 entries). Any mutation request (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) clears the entire cache. The server can opt out per-response with the `silcrow-cache: no-cache` header.

```js
Silcrow.cache.has("/dashboard");  // check cache
Silcrow.cache.clear("/dashboard"); // clear one entry
Silcrow.cache.clear();             // clear all
```

### Preloading

Elements with `s-preload` fire a background fetch on `mouseenter`. The response is cached so the subsequent click is instant.

```html
<a s-action="/settings" s-preload>Settings</a>
```

### History & Scroll

Full-page GET navigations push to `history.pushState`. On popstate (back/forward), Silcrow re-fetches the URL and restores the saved scroll position. Partial updates (those with `s-target`) skip history by default.

### Loading States

During requests, Silcrow adds `silcrow-loading` CSS class and `aria-busy="true"` to the target element. Style it however you want:

```css
.silcrow-loading { opacity: 0.5; pointer-events: none; }
```

### Abort & Timeout

Navigating to the same target while a GET is in-flight aborts the previous request. Mutation requests are never aborted. Timeout defaults to 30 seconds and can be set per-element with `s-timeout`.

---

## Live: SSE, WebSocket & Real-Time Updates

### Declarative with `s-live`

Add `s-live` to any element to automatically open an SSE connection on page load. The attribute value is the SSE endpoint URL:

```html
<div id="feed" s-live="/events/feed">
  <span s-bind="count"></span> items
</div>
```

Silcrow scans for `s-live` elements during initialization. When the server sends an SSE message, the data is parsed as JSON and piped to `Silcrow.patch()` on that element.

### WebSocket with `s-live`

Prefix the URL with `ws:` to use WebSocket instead of SSE:

```html
<div id="chat" s-live="ws:/ws/chat">
  <span s-bind="messages"></span>
</div>
```

Without a prefix, `s-live` defaults to SSE for backward compatibility.

### Connection Sharing

When multiple elements connect to the same WebSocket URL, Silcrow opens a single
shared connection. Messages with an explicit `target` selector are applied once to
the matching element. Messages without a target fan out to all subscribed elements.

This is automatic — no configuration needed. If you need isolated connections to the
same URL (rare), use distinct query parameters: `ws:/ws/chat?room=1` vs `ws:/ws/chat?room=2`.

### Programmatic with `Silcrow.live()`

```js
Silcrow.live("#dashboard", "/events/dashboard");
```

Opens an `EventSource` to the given URL. Every `message` event is parsed as JSON and passed to `Silcrow.patch()` on the root element.

### SSE Message Format

The server sends standard SSE messages. The `data` field must be valid JSON:

```text
data: {"count": 42, "status": "online"}
```

Silcrow also supports named SSE events for specific actions:

| Event Name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `message` (default) | Parsed as JSON, passed to `Silcrow.patch()` on the root |
| `patch` | Parsed and patched. Supports direct payload (`{...}` / `[...]`) on root, or `{target, data}` to patch a specific selector |
| `html` | Swaps HTML via `safeSetHTML()`. Supports `{target, html}`; empty `html` clears target content |
| `invalidate` | Calls `Silcrow.invalidate()` on the root (no data needed) |
| `navigate` | `data` field is a URL path — triggers client-side navigation |

```http
event: navigate
data: /dashboard

event: invalidate
data:

event: patch
data: {"users": [{"key": "1", "name": "Alice"}]}

event: patch
data: {"target":"#dashboard","data":{"count":42}}

event: html
data: {"target":"#slot","html":"<p>Updated</p>"}

```

### Reconnection

When an SSE connection drops, Silcrow reconnects automatically with exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → ... up to a maximum of 30 seconds. Backoff resets on successful reconnection or on a manual `Silcrow.reconnect()` call.

### `Silcrow.disconnect(root)`

Pauses the SSE connection for a root. The connection is closed and automatic reconnection is stopped.

```js
Silcrow.disconnect("#feed");
```

### `Silcrow.reconnect(root)`

Resumes a disconnected SSE connection. Resets the backoff timer and reconnects immediately.

```js
Silcrow.reconnect("#feed");
```

---

### Sending Messages (WebSocket only)

WebSocket connections are bidirectional. Use `Silcrow.send()` to send data to the server:

```js
Silcrow.send("#chat", { type: "custom", event: "message", data: { text: "Hello" } });
```

`send()` is a no-op on SSE connections (SSE is server-to-client only). The connection must be open — if not, a warning is logged.

### WebSocket Message Format

WebSocket messages are JSON objects with a `type` field that matches the Rust `WsEvent` enum:

| Type | Fields | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `patch` | `target`, `data` | Patches JSON data into target element via `Silcrow.patch()` |
| `html` | `target`, `markup` | Swaps HTML into target element via `safeSetHTML()` |
| `invalidate` | `target` | Rebuilds binding maps for target element |
| `navigate` | `path` | Triggers client-side navigation |
| `custom` | `event`, `data` | Dispatches `silcrow:ws:{event}` CustomEvent on document |

```jsonl
{"type": "patch", "target": "#stats", "data": {"count": 42}}
{"type": "html", "target": "#slot", "markup": "<p>Updated</p>"}
{"type": "navigate", "path": "/dashboard"}
{"type": "custom", "event": "refresh", "data": {"section": "sidebar"}}

```

---

## Optimistic Updates

### `Silcrow.optimistic(root, data)`

Takes a snapshot of the root element's current DOM state, then immediately patches the data. Use this for instant UI feedback before the server confirms:

```js
// User clicks "like" — update immediately
Silcrow.optimistic("#post-42", { likes: currentLikes + 1, liked: true });

// Send to server
Silcrow.go("/api/posts/42/like", { method: "POST", target: "#post-42" });
```

### `Silcrow.revert(root)`

Restores the DOM to the state captured by `Silcrow.optimistic()`. Call this when the server request fails:

```js
try {
  await fetch("/api/posts/42/like", { method: "POST" });
} catch (err) {
  Silcrow.revert("#post-42");
  showError("Failed to save");
}
```

`revert()` restores the element's `innerHTML` and calls `Silcrow.invalidate()` to rebuild binding maps since the DOM was replaced.

### Optimistic + Error Handler Pattern

Combine optimistic updates with the error handler for a clean pattern:

```js
Silcrow.onError((err, { url, target }) => {
  // Revert any optimistic updates on the failed target
  Silcrow.revert(target);
});
```

---

## Toast System

Register a toast handler to receive toast notifications from both JSON payloads and cookie-based HTML responses:

```js
Silcrow.onToast((message, level) => {
  showNotification(message, level); // your UI
});
```

**JSON responses:** Toasts are read from the `_toasts` array in the payload, then removed before patching. If the payload was wrapped by the server (non-object root with toasts), Silcrow unwraps it.

**HTML/redirect responses:** Toasts are read from the `silcrow_toasts` cookie (URL-encoded JSON array), then the cookie is immediately cleared.

---

## Events

All events bubble and are dispatched on `document` (except `silcrow:patched` which fires on the root element).

| Event | Detail | Cancelable | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `silcrow:navigate` | `{url, method, trigger, target}` | Yes | Before any fetch |
| `silcrow:before-swap` | `{url, target, content, isJSON, proceed}` | Yes | After fetch, before DOM update |
| `silcrow:load` | `{url, target, redirected}` | No | After successful swap |
| `silcrow:error` | `{error, url}` | No | On fetch error or timeout |
| `silcrow:patched` | `{paths}` | No | After `patch()` completes |
| `silcrow:sse` | `{path}` | No | When server sends `silcrow-sse` header |
| `silcrow:live:connect` | `{root, url}` | No | SSE connection opened |
| `silcrow:live:disconnect` | `{root, url, reconnectIn}` | No | SSE connection lost (with backoff ms) |
| `silcrow:optimistic` | `{root, data}` | No | After optimistic patch applied |
| `silcrow:revert` | `{root}` | No | After DOM reverted to snapshot |

**Transition hook:** Listen to `silcrow:before-swap` and call `event.detail.proceed()` manually to control when the DOM update happens (e.g., after a CSS transition). If no listener calls `proceed()`, Silcrow executes it automatically.

---

## Lifecycle

```js
// Register handlers (chainable)
Silcrow
  .onToast((msg, level) => { /* ... */ })
  .onRoute(({ url, finalUrl, redirected, method, response, contentType, target }) => {
    // Return false to prevent the default swap
  })
  .onError((err, { url, method, trigger, target }) => {
    // Custom error handling
  });

// Teardown — removes all event listeners, clears caches, closes SSE connections
Silcrow.destroy();
```
